            olMail.To = cell.Cells(1, n - 1)    'take email address from D(1,n-1) which is equal to B column of corresponding row where reminder is needed in column D
            olMail.Subject = cell.Cells(1, n)   'take CR number from D(1,n) which is equal to C column of corresponding row where reminder is needed in column D

'so how the loop works: variable "cell" takes value from D2, doesnt equal to "send reminder" go to next loop
'variable "cell" takes value from D3, equals to "send reminder" so it creates email:
'with field TO= "cell"(with coorditanes 1 and n-1)= B3. Coordinates are taken relatively to D3
'with field Subject = "cell"(with coordinates 1 and n)= C3. Coordinates are taken relatively to D3
'with Body = "Please update documentation for CR - " + C3
